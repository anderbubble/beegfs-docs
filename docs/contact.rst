If you want to keep up to date regarding news, events and features of
BeeGFS, you should subscribe to the monthly newsletter at
thinkparq.com/news or follow us on twitter. On the ThinkParQ news
page, you will also find the release announcement list, a special low
volume mailing list where you get a notification when a new BeeGFS
release becomes available.

If you want to become part of the BeeGFS community, you can also join
the BeeGFS user mailing list by subscribing at beegfs.io/support. On
the public mailing list, users can ask other users for help or discuss
interesting topics. Note that the development team does not regularly
check the posts on the public mailing list, as this is only part of
the professional support.

If you are interested in more information, need help building your
first BeeGFS storage system or want to become a BeeGFS partner for
turn-key solutions, you can contact us at: info@thinkparq.com
